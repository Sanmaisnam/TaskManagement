## Custom Data Structure 
An Array list is a dynamic data structure in java, it allows us to store a collection of data. In our project we have used a custom array list  defined by the class call <b>Taskmanager</b> (showed in the UML diagram). Each attribute element of that class will be a reference of an object in our custom array list.  <br/>

<b> Why customizing an array list </b>

Compare to the predefined  array list in java with its in built class such string or Integer for example, will allow us only to manipulate our data point base on those class configuration, In order to have more flexibility, more control over our data we have designed a specific class called Taskmanager, which is going to work perfectly with our need and data manipulation.<br/> A custom array list give us freedom  with our custom class to store numerous data point to a created object.

<b> why Array list over an Array</b> <br/>

In order to use an array, we need to define its size first before any manipulation which might lead either to outbound memory or memory waste. The good thing with an array list is that, the allocated memory happen when it is required (real time memory allocation "dynamic")
